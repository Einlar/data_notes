# Finite State Machine
A Finite-state machine (FSM) is an *abstract machine* that can be in exactly one of a finite number of states at any given time. 

A (Moore) FSM consists of a **state register**, that is a circuit capable of storing some amount of information for a certain time. The state is read by an *output* circuit, that applies some logic. At the same time, the state is fed to an additional block of logic, that integrates it with the inputs and uses it to produce the *next state*, which is then stored in the register. 

An example is a **pattern recognizer** (slide 13). The green arrows denote the machine's *inputs*. The idea is to output $1$ iff the last $4$ inputs were $0101$ (in that order).
