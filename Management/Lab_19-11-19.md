# Simulation
VHDL is designed with the following aims:
- **Documentation**: be a formal method for describing a digital circuit
- **Synthesis**: translate a formal description of a circuit in the *concrete* sequential structure of a digital circuit
- **Verification**: be able to *simulate* a circuit and check if its behaviour matches the required specifications, *before* implementing it

Today we will focus on this last one. Note that only a subset of the language constructs is synthesizable - for example a *stimulus* is not. However, it is possible to *simulate* every construct - even its inputs. 

## Testbench
To simulate inputs we will create a *testbench*. This is an `entity` without `Port()`, that instantiates the gate to be simulated (e.g. `top`, through `name : gate_name port map (name_of_port_in_gate => name_of_port_in_testbench)`) and defines a `process` for choosing its inputs. 

The simulation will automatically check the VHDL syntax (as does the synthesis, but the simulation is usually faster), and allows to check the *behaviour* of the circuit (with or without considering the delays of a real electronic system). 

```vhdl
entity tb_top is
-- Port( );
end tb_top;

architecture Behavioral of tb_top is

component top is
    Port (btn_in: in std_logic;
          led_out : out std_logic );
end component;

signal btn, led : std_logic;

begin

uut : top port map (btn_in => btn, led_out => led);

pl : process
    begin
        btn >= '0';
        wait for 200 ns
        btn <= '1';
        wait for 200 ns
        btn <= '0>;
        wait for 200 ns;
    end process
end Behavioral;
```
